            <h2 class="Name"> My name is Lerissa Lazar </h2>
            <p class="Para">
                I am 20 years old and I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia.
                When I am bored, I love to paint,customize shoes, go online shopping, play games
                and watch anime. I have a cute pitbull named thor, and a fish without a name. Before I found out about
                Codestack, I was going to Modesto Junior College to purse a career in teaching, specifically a Math
                teacher. The
                thing stopping me from doing so was the lack of motivation from all the useless courses I had to take,
                which
                made me tired of regular school.
